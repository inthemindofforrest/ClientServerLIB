How to setup Server:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

TUP  - Function that takes in nothing and returns Void
sTUP - Function that takes in a std::string and returns Void.


1) Create a new Server. The server will need to take in three parameters:
	a) sTUP _ConsoleFunction - Function that should handle Console Commands
	b) TUP _SendClientFunction - Function that should handle sending information to clients
	c) sTUP _ProcessPacketFunction - Function that should process all incoming packets

2) Choose 1 of 3 startup functions. One of them needs to be ran to start up the server.
	a) StartServer(void) - Starts a default server with the current Device IP and Port(9999)
	b) StartServer(Params) - Starts a server with the IP and port given by Developer
	c) StartConfigServer(void) - Allows the server owner to type the IP and Port when the server Console is started

3) Update the server using ServerUpdate() which runs the Process Packet function the developer had specified

4) When server is ready to close, call shutdown() to safely make sure all sockets are closed correctly. And to close all open threads
run CloseAllThreads().

--Any game (Server) Logic that needs to be ran, should be ran beside updating the server.
