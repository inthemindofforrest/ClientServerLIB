How to setup Client:
--------------------------------------------------------------------

TUP  - Function that takes in nothing and returns Void
sTUP - Function that takes in a std::string and returns Void.


1) Create a new Client. The client will need to take in one parameters:
	- sTUP _Function - Function that should handle processing packets

2) Choose 1 of 3 startup functions. One of them needs to be ran to start up the server.

	a) StartClient(sTUP) - Starts a default server with the current Device IP and Port(9999), and it will 
	also run sTUP when packets are proccessed

	b) StartCustomClient(sTUP) - Starts a client with the IP and port given by Developer, and it will 
	also run sTUP when packets are proccessed

	c) StartCustomClient(sTUP, const char *, int) - Allows the client to type the IP and Port when the 
	client Console is started. it will also run sTUP when packets are proccessed

3) Update the client using UpdateClient() which runs the Process Packet function the developer had specified

4) When client is ready to close, Disconnect from server! And then call shutdown() to safely make sure all 
sockets are closed correctly. And to close all open threads run CloseAllThreads().

--Any game (Client) Logic that needs to be ran, should be ran beside updating the client.
